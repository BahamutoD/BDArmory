	@title = APG-77v1 air-to-ground Radar (Snub)
	@description = The AN/APG-77v1 is a forward facing, aerodynamically housed, solid-state, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. It provides full air-to-ground functionality at a MAX operating range of 40km against stationary and moving targets within a 120 degree field of view. This particular unit is optimized for Ground combat, and has difficulties locking air targets.
