    @description = This is a two-man fighter cockpit with a Mk2 cross section. Inspired by the F-22, the module has built-in air intakes, a fully loaded IVA and a huge glass canopy. You'll be able to clearly see all around you. Just hope it can withstand the vacuum of space. Accessible through the MFDs are several external cameras. This cockpit is coated with radar absorbent material (RAM) and significantly reduces the radar cross section of the plane.
    @cost = 10500   // yeah, stealth coating is expensive!
    @maxTemp = 1000  //stealth coating is fragile, hence values lowered!
    @skinMaxTemp = 1500  //stealth coating is fragile, hence values lowered!

                        // to reduce only the radar cross section, but without providing another jamming effect!

        lockBreakerStrength = 0	// factor (in relation to a vessels base radar cross section) how strong the lockbreaking effect is
