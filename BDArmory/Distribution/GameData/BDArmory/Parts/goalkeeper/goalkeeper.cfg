	description = A 7 barrel 30mm rotary cannon with full swivel range.  The 30mm high explosive rounds self detonate at the set distance, but this weapon does not feature automatic fuse timing. It has its own detection & tracking radar, though that is only effective at close range and does not replace a proper volumen serach radar.
