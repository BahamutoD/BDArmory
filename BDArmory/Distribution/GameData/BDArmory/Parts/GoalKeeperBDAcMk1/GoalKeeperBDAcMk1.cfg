	description = A 7 barrel 30mm rotary cannon with full swivel range.This MK 1 version was found under a tarpaulin in a muddy field, Perfect for cash strapped militias and shifty governments (cheapskate version) Without Radar or detection equipment this turret requires the target information to be fed from an alternative source.(somebody pointing and shouting 'shoot that' has been found to be only marginally effective due to the excessive noise produced when the weapon fires)  The 30mm high explosive rounds self detonate when they lose interest in flying, but this weapon does not feature automatic fuse timing. 30x173
