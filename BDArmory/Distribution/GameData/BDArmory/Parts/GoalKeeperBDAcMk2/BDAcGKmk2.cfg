description = A 7 barrel 30mm rotary cannon with full swivel range. This MK 2 version was found covered in overspray and paint cans around the back of the hangar at the old KSC,  developed from the MK1 to reduce the incidence of hearing loss amongst early target pointers. This MK2 has some slight advantages over the MK1, equipped with Infra red targeting and Radar data reciever    The 30x173mm high explosive rounds are only a slight improvement over the MK1 ammunition in that they at least take slightly longer to lose interest in flying and so have a good chance of reaching the target, but this weapon was never equipped to feature automatic fuse timing.
