v1.2.2.2
* Recompiled for KSP 1.4.5

* FIXES
    *Error spam in Log when a radar is destroyed.  An orphaned index was not properly being updated. 
     Reported in BDAc Forum post: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155014-14x-bdarmory-continued-v1221-7102018-vessel-mover-camera-tools-bdmk22-destruction-effects-burn-together/&do=findComment&comment=3425233
     Thanks to greydragon70 for his thoughtful evaluation of BDac and issue reporting.
    * Corrected an error where high speed missiles would sometimes not detonate in the correct location.

* ENHANCEMENTS:
  * Increased maximum allowable missles per target to 18, up from 6.
  * Added EMP Module.  Now Electromagnetic pulses exist in game that can disable electronics within the blast range.
  * Added 2 new EMP equipped missiles  HellFire EMP, and AIM-120 EMP.  Small pulse radius but demonstrates the feature.
  * Added 3 different sized EMP pulse FX, allows for additional sized pulse weapons.
  * Added Reloadable Missile Rail (ModuleMissileRearm.  Now missile launchers can be reloadable!  
    This module can be added to missile launcher designs to allow reloading. (code used with permission courtesy of @flywyx).  
    Requires unity based modifications,  normal rails will not function as reloadable unless additional transforms are added.
  * Added new standard resource High Explosive.  Provides better matching of tntMass for balance.
  * Added an Ammo switcher feature (no more Firespitter required)
  * Added new Universal Ammo Box part that uses the new Ammo switcher feature.  Old part remains for backawards compatability.  
    Use the new part going forward.  To remove the need for FireSpitter, replace existing Ammo Box parts with the new part on existing craft.
  * Improved sub categories for BDA parts.  This helps with the clutter in the Editor under the BDA category.
  * Removed BDACategoryModule as a result of the BDA categories refactor.  
    Existing craft may see a module not found warnings in the log.  This will have no ill effects and can be safely ignored.
  * Improved smoke effects for smoke canister launchers
  * Added new Jet engine based on the J-404.  Licensed from KTech. (Thanks @TheKurgan, @SpannerMonkey(SMCE) & @XOC2008!)
  * Added new BDAc Test Drone MKIII craft, utilizing the new engine.
  * Added engagement rules to all missiles


v1.2.2.1

  * Added Jettison action to parts TweakUI in flight.  Git Issue #539
  * (Internal) Some code refactoring (basic cleanup, Module reorganization)
  * Deprecate the Cannon weaponType.   Going forward, Ballistic should be used instead.  Cannon remains (backwards compatibility), but will be eventually removed.
  * (Internal) Updated build process to improve multi developer build and deployments.  Simplified KSP version change dev environment build process.

  * Bullet trajectories and Pilot AI should no longer be affected by vessel movement and vessel switching


v1.0.0

* NEW FEATURES:

  * Radar & Stealth, re-design of how the radar system works:
    - New radar reflection shader (credit: original great idea by JR!), calculating cross section in m^2:
       + allows building for stealth using angled surfaces (“scatter those pesky radar waves away!”)
       + calculation is normalized so that a 1x1 structural plate directly frontally facing the radar yields a return of exactly 1 m^2
    - Redesign of the radar system, radars all have different ranges & detection performance:
       + radar part configs changed, new fields (floatcurves) to define detection and lock/track performance, new field to specify ground clutter effectiveness
    - New in-editor analysis window to help evaluate a craft’s cross section and performance against selectable radars
    - New options for configuration of radar guided missiles in the part config:
       + can now explicitly specify active seeker performance (via a FloatCurve, similar to radars)
       + can now explicitly specify the static radar cross section of a missile for detection purpose
    - Adjustment of the Chaff countermeasure system: more gradual effect of decoying missiles away (instead of previous “all-or-nothing”)
    - Adjustment of IR missiles and flare countermeasures: simulating now more of a “imaging infrared” seeker than an old dumb seeker – to be successfully decoyed, flares have to more closely match the thermal spectrum of the part the seeker has locked on to

  * Massive improvements to ballistic missile guidance and modular missiles, ability to simulate ICBM flight paths:
    - Ballistic guidance has been enhanced to allow firing missiles accurately even at distances greater than 500 km
    - A new field called BallisticOverShootFactor has been added to missiles, the greater the value the further the missile will go before the terminal maneuver begins
    - By default all missiles now can steer in vacuum. New field called "vacuumSteerable" can be set to false to disable this behaviour    
    - Auto SAS activation when the missile is fired. Before it was only activated if the parent vessel had it switched on.
    - Improved the Cruise and Ballistic Guidance. Ballistic Guidance will switch to AGM guidance as soon as it reached the 50% of the distance
    - Guard mode in space will consider orbiting vessels as "flying" (air targets), hence engagement of space targets is possible now
 
  * New dedicated sonar ping and torpedo ping sounds, courtesy of PapaJoe!

* FIXES / ENHANCEMENTS:

  * Localization updates, including chinese localization (thanks @ACEA)
  * Fixed indestructible Kerbals - weapons/explosions have effect on Kerbals again! (thanks @Designer225)
  * Fixed AIPilot problem with drag estimations (thanks @RichardDastardly)
  * Fix missile infinite fuel
  * Fix rwr window invisible in fresh installs
  * Display ranges of RWR and radar display now linked, selectable display range of radar display up to configured PRE physics max range!
  * Window position saving also for vesselswitcher
  * Prevent active radar missiles locking onto anything they see, now obey engagement settings
  * Sonar pings and torpedos only show on RWR if vessel is splashed/submerged
  * Fix guard mode "cheating" - now must have detected an enemy with radar/sonar or with visual range before it can attack it
  * If a cruise missile has terminal guidance, it can be switched off (before launch) in the part action window. The missile will then be purely gps guided without engaging its terminal targeting mode
  * If debug labels are enabled, upon entering the editor all bda parts & their properties (if relevant for balancing) are dumped into .csv files for convenient analysis in excel
  * Complete review of all event handlers, should reduce some actual or potential nullrefs upon explosive vessel disassembly
  * General performance improvements due to code refactoring

* New Parts

	* Courtesy of SpannerMonkey 
		- BDA MK1 Sonar Pod
		- Sting Ray  BDA LightWeight Torpedo
		
* Notes on Naval Combat Features

	* Current implementation of "Sonar" reuses the current Radar code. Future state will have dedicated windows and naming convention
	* Activating a "Sonar" pod still says "Activate Radar"
	* A Sonar is defined by setting the rwrThreatType = 6
		- Sonar rules
			- Will only detect vessels that are underwater (> 20meters)
			- Sonar will not function if vessel is in flight
			- Sonar does not detect "Landed" vessels, only splashed
			- Normal Radar does not detect underwater vessels, still detects "Splashed" i.e. Boats
	* Engagment type "SLW" only targets underwater (submarines) and Splashed (Boats)

v0.2.0.0
= New features=
- Modular Missile Guidance:
	A full rewrite of this part has been done. Now you can build your own missiles, define all its parameters,
	even its name. And it will be used by the AI as if it was a stock BDArmory missile!

	If you want to know more about this new feature, you can download a custom part pack for procedural missiles:
	https://github.com/jrodrigv/BDModularMissileParts
	And read this wiki
	https://github.com/jrodrigv/BDModularMissileParts/wiki/1.-Building-your-first-Modular-Missile

- Proximity Fuse for Missiles: 
	A new field called "detonation distance override" has been added to missiles.

= Changes =
- BDALoadedVesselSwitcher has been integrated into BDArmory, it will not be a separate mod anymore.

	Now the physics range has been extended to almost 200 km. 
	However, be careful with landed vessels. Even if the vessel still loaded it could be possible that the terrain beneath it's not there anymore.
